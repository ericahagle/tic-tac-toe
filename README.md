### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

_Instructions on how to clone to local and launch will go here_ </br>
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step etc.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

_screenshot(s) and/or video(s) will go here_

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

**Kickoff Date:** Tuesday, September 18, 2023, 11am MT </br>

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with? Add bullets from spec.)

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

**Wins:**
- wins go here in bullets

**Challenges:**
