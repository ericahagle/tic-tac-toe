### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with? Add bullets from spec.)

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

**Wins:**
- wins go here in bullets

**Challenges:**
- challenges go here in bullets
