# tic-tac-toe
Turing Mod1 Final Solo Project

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

What we have here is a simple Tic Tac Toe game:
- Each player in the game is controlled manually by the user
- The top banner displays which player’s turn it is
- Each player can only place their token in an empty square
  - If a player attempts to place their token on a square that’s already occupied, it will not work
  - It remains that player's turn
- Once a player places their token, it becomes the other player’s turn
  - The banner updates to communicate this
- If a player wins (by connecting 3 horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
  - The top banner changes to declare the winner
  - The declared winner's total wins updates
- If a draw occurs (all squares are filled, but no win was detected)
  - The top banner changes to declare a draw
  - Neither player’s win count increases nor decreases
- If either a win or draw occurs
  - The game restarts automatically after 3 seconds
  - The player who didn’t begin the previous match now is the first player to go in the new match

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

To clone the repo and run it locally on your own machine: </br>
1. Navigate to the repo in your browser: https://github.com/ericahagle/tic-tac-toe
2. Clone the repo to the desired location on your machine
3. `cd` into the new `tic-tac-toe` directory
4. Type `open index.html` in your terminal and hit enter to launch the app in your default browser
5. Have fun!

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide gifs or screenshots of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

**Kickoff Date:** Tuesday, September 18, 2023, 11am MT </br>
**Due Date:** Tuesday, September 26, 2023, 6pm MT

As of Tuesday, September 26, 2023, and the end of this project, I will be in the middle of the sixth (and final) week of FE Mod 1 at Turing School of Software & Design.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with? Add bullets from spec.)

- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

**Wins:**
- wins go here in bullets

**Challenges:**
- challenges go here in bullets
